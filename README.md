# Project 3: Spots

## Summary

Spots is a social media application in which users can upload photos and like other users' photos. Users can add their name, a short bio, and an avatar image.

## Technologies and Techniques

Markup was written using HTML5, and styles were written using CSS3 based on the design provided on Figma, a collaborative design tool. CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, and media queries were used to create a responsive site with columnns that adjust based on screen size.

## Plans for Improvement

Currently, the site is serves as a semi-interactive template for the application. The buttons have hover states, but clicking them doesn't execute anything (one can't actually create a new post). Additionally, the site lacks social functions; there isn't an option to follow or search for other users. The implementation of these features would create a fully functional.
