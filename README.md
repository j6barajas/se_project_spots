# Project 3: Spots

## Summary

Spots is a photo sharing application. Users can create their own profile, and they can upload, like, and delete their photos.

## Technologies and Techniques

Markup was written using HTML, and styles were written using CSS based on a Figma design. One of the main educational points of this project was responsive design, particularly for mobile phones. This was achieved through the use of CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries. Spots was also great practice for utilizing event listeners and implementing form validation with Javascript.
